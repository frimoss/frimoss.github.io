                    <p><b>Volunteering</b> (from lat. voluntarius — voluntary) or voluntary activity — is a voluntary gratuitous activity for the benefit of society and individual citizens. If we formulate the definition in non–official terms, then — <i>Volunteering is a free job in order to help everyone who needs it.</i></p>

                    <p>Volunteering arose when humanity arose. The need to survive in difficult conditions led primitive people to rally and be prepared to help.</p>

                    <img src="assets/img/1_2.jpg" alt="">

                    <p>For many years, the concept of volunteering was a military term, since it was the main way of recruiting armies, which continued until the introduction of universal military service. In the 18th and 19th centuries in Austria-Hungary, France, Italy volunteer regiments acted as part of the regular army.</p>

                    <p>After the First World War in 1920, the first youth volunteer project "It is better to work together than to fight against each other" began in Strasbourg, France. The project participants (young Germans and French) restored destroyed farms in the area of the most fierce battles between German and French troops. Since then, volunteering has managed to gain momentum and popularity on a global scale. Various forms, types, and duration of activity have been determined in volunteering.</p>

                    <p>From this first international volunteer camp in the history of mankind, the first volunteer movement arose, which exists to this day. It bears the French name Service Civil International (International Civil Assistance).</p>
                    <img class="img__right" src="assets/img/1_3.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, one of the oldest and largest volunteer movements — Red Cross Society was born. The founder of which was a Swiss entrepreneur and public figure Henri Dunant.</p>

                    <p>All segments of the population participate in volunteering, regardless of the level of education, profession and income. Volunteering is considered as a form of civic participation in socially useful affairs, a way of collective interaction and an effective mechanism for solving urgent social and pedagogical problems. Thus, volunteering has become an important component of a democratic society.</p>

                    <p>The history of the volunteer movement in Russia differs from the foreign one. In Russia, the idea of volunteering (volunteerism) goes back to ancient times, to the depths of Russian history, when Russians brought up on the moral and ethical traditions of Orthodoxy gratuitous assistance to fellow citizens in need.</p>

                    <p>The development of volunteering in Russia begins shortly after 988, with the adoption of Christianity. Russian history is rich in examples of volunteer work of famous and wealthy Russians.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/1_4.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>The famous Russian surgeon N.I. Pirogov during the Crimean War in 1855 organized the Holy Cross Community of Sisters of Mercy, whose members as volunteers cared for the wounded.</p>

                    <p>In the royal family, it was considered important to set an example of charity and voluntary service. Thus, a community of mercy operated in Tsarskoye Selo.</p>

                    <p>After the 1917 revolution in Russia, volunteerism became an integral part of the life of every citizen of the country. In the early years of Soviet government, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subbotnik" target="_blank" style="color: #5d9eff;font-weight: 500">subbotniks</a> were an expression of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses.</p>

                    <p>Children and youth were actively involved in volunteering in Soviet Union through the youth movements of the Octobrists, Pioneers, and Komsomol members. And the heroes of the work "Timur and his team" inspired and continue to inspire generations of schoolchildren to do good deeds.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/1_5.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>During the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945, thousands of Russian citizens volunteered for the front.</p>

                    <p>After the war, in the 1950s, a mass movement began to develop the lands of Kazakhstan, the Volga region, the Urals, Siberia, and the Far East. Thousands of volunteers from all over the country took part in the implementation of this task.</p>

                    <p>In 1974, the construction of the Baikal-Amur Railway was declared an All-Russian Komsomol construction site, and it was very fashionable to work as a volunteer on the construction of the BAM. Thousands of people went to Siberia for the taiga romance.</p>

                    <p>There was a powerful movement of voluntary blood donors in the USSR, and being a donor was extremely honorable.</p>

                    <p>The concept of volunteering came to Russia in the early 1990s. Non—profit organizations have appeared — organizations whose main goal is not profit. They engaged in charity work, educational activities and the creation of conditions for volunteers.</p>
