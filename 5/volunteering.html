                <p><b style="color: #5d9eff;">1.</b> Firstly, it is an opportunity to see another world. Some international organizations are looking for volunteers anywhere in the world and your professional or intellectual abilities can be useful on the other side of the Earth. So this is a great opportunity to travel and gain impressions, experience and knowledge. And yes, a trip to the next street, where there is a kennel for dogs or a cancer care center, is also a discovery of the whole world. Another, but no less important.</p>
                
                <p><b style="color: #5d9eff;">2.</b> This is an opportunity to greatly change the usual environment and occupation, to break the standard scheme of existence. Sometimes it is vital. This is one of the most common reasons why a taxi company dispatcher goes to an orphanage to bake pies, and an office worker goes to the forest to look for a missing grandmother.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/2_2.jpg" alt="">
                <p><b style="color: #5d9eff;">3.</b> Volunteering will allow (and even force!) you get to know people and communicate. It can be interesting, really lively and not boring, and most importantly, very useful. Volunteer teams bring together surprisingly different people, men and women who would never have met in other circumstances. It's a very unique experience.</p>

                <p><b style="color: #5d9eff;">4.</b> When a person does something as a volunteer, he feels that he is doing the right thing. No matter what you do and what you love, this is the right feeling.</p>
                
                <p><b style="color: #5d9eff;">5.</b> In moments of depression and self-flagellation, people who are engaged in volunteering understand: they don't live in this world for nothing. It sounds rude, but selfless help to others satisfies a person's basic need to feel good.</p>

                <p><b style="color: #5d9eff;">6.</b> Anyone should help those who need help, if they have the opportunity. For many, this is an axiom. Therefore, volunteering is a way for them to fulfill this duty.</p>
                
                <p><b style="color: #5d9eff;">7.</b> Being among people who spend their time volunteering is a joy. They are not saints, not altruists, not blessed, not perfect, they have very different characters and motives, but at the same time there is one thing in common: they are not indifferent. It is good, useful and pleasant to be in the company of caring people.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/2_3.jpg" alt="">
                <p><b style="color: #5d9eff;">8.</b> Volunteers change lives for the better. A volunteer is a soldier of a huge army of goodness, which is growing every day. It is the volunteers who achieve what was not in our life before. They draw the attention of society to what it had previously passed by indifferently. Never before have we visited the elderly in nursing homes, did not go to play with children with disabilities, did not extinguish forest fires, did not give love to homeless dogs in shelters. This means that life has become a little easier for lonely grandfathers, special children, homeless animals and many others.</p>
                
                <p><b style="color: #5d9eff;">9.</b> Volunteering is very diverse, everyone can find what they like in it. Someone likes to mess with animals, someone gets to communicate well with children, someone likes the romance of night searches, and someone is sick of the soul for the older people. There is always an opportunity to realize yourself!</p>

                <p><b style="color: #5d9eff;">10.</b> Volunteering helps to fight your own fears. It teaches not only to treat illness, death, and life differently, but also to communicate correctly with people in a difficult situation. Not to be afraid of children with disabilities, not to look away from a disabled person, not understanding how to behave, but to be able to lend a helping hand.</p>

                <p><b style="color: #5d9eff;">11.</b> This is a good example for the younger generation. It's impossible to teach goodness. It can only be "vaccinated". And when children see that their parents regularly help someone for free, share what they have with strangers, then doing good becomes something completely natural. The norm.</p>
